# How Web Works

## How we suppose web Works:

![Front End](https://github.com/RamejaAyush/Front-End/blob/Web_working/Media/Suppose.png?raw=true)

We suppose we search for website which has a unique URL and we get the site we are looking for.

No This is Wrong.

Every website has a unique IP Address through which we can access the website.

## How Web Actually Works:

\*note: Every website is actually stored into a server.

So, When we request for any website firstly it goes to DNS server.

### DNS server (Domain Name System Server):

When a Web address (URL) is typed into a browser, DNS servers return the IP address of the Web server associated with that name. In this made-up example, the DNS converts the URL www.company.com into the IP address 204.0.8.51. Without DNS, you would have to type the series of four numbers and dots into your browser to retrieve the website, which you actually can do.

So It means we can also access the web with the IP address?

Yes we can access it.

Try searching "142.250.190.78"

## What happens when we gets the website files?

We actually gets a copy of the website. We can access the code from the inspect element.
